# SIR Model Simulation with Binomial Infection

This Python project simulates the spread of an infectious disease using the SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) model. This model consider binomial distribution for infection. The project is organized into modules for the SIR model, visualization, interfaces, and simulations.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `epidemic/`: Contains the SIR model implementation and visualization functions.
- `interfaces/`: Provides interfaces for interacting with the SIR model and visualization.
- `simulations/`: Includes scripts for running simulations and generating distribution graphs.
- `tests/`: Contains unit tests for the SIR model.

## Dependencies

To run this project, you'll need Python and the following libraries:

- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install these dependencies using `pip` with the provided `requirements.txt` file.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/HibaDoudar/Model1.git
